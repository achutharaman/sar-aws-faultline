"""The check registry: the one seam that keeps adding a check from touching core.

A check is any class carrying the class-level metadata below and a ``run``
method. Registration is a decorator, discovery is automatic, and third parties
can ship checks from their own distributions via the ``sar_aws_faultline.checks``
entry-point group without this repo knowing they exist.

Same contract as sar-aws-barnacle, extended with the four attributes a security
finding needs that a cost finding does not: ``severity``, ``audit_impact``,
``rationale`` and ``remediation``.
